Description:
Guess a user's number within a specified range
The user will input a range where their guess is within that range
The function will continually subdivide the range and prompt the user
if their number is above or below the new range

Function:

The user's 'range' should simply be an integer input
Redefine the range as a list of numbers from 0 to the top limit
(n+1 since range is not inclusive)
